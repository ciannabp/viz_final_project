## Teresa's peer review

I really appreciate you showed iterations of plots and used commentary to explain the purposes/hypotheses of each data visualization.  Your codes are easy to follow along and selection of plots is to the point. You are a good story teller! The document is reproducible expect that for some reason I can't get waffle charts working. The error menssage was "Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...) : (list) object cannot be coerced to type 'double'".

As for styling, I placed several spaces around all infix operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.) in your codes and broke down couple long codes into different lines. You could use this [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) from Hadley Wickham as a reference.   

Thanks to your code, now I know how to access the data of ggplot object, I'll defintely play around with it!


```{r setup, include = FALSE}

# I'd suggest to include this setup chuck for global setting, including all libraries used in the document.
