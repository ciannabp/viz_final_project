#participants were asked if overall, they consider the internet to be a good or bad thing for society. I am curious if the distribution of ages varies by response.

#BC: I like your idea to include more axis labels. Since we're talking about age, I agree that the default labeling width of 40 years is too high. Since the max age is 99, one suggestion might be to limit your x axis to 100 (see above).

# ggplot_build creates, and then extracting the first element of that list.

#BC: Again, limiting x axis to 100 here. I really like your idea to label the highest density point for each of the distributions. It makes it really easy to see that the clearest age-related differences in attitudes about the internet acutally has to do with uncertainty about those attitudes. So fascinating! Also, I like your subtitle, as it makes it immediately obvious what your reponse categories mean. One suggestion might be to make the distributions different colors for double encoding of your different response categories, just to make them even more visually distinct. Love this graph!

#from this graph we can see that youtube and facebook are pretty dominant across all frequencies of general internet usage.

#this shows a pretty clear message that YouTube and Facebook are dominant for single platform users. However, since we just made a chart similar to this for different information, maybe this is a good candidate for a waffle plot. A waffle plot might also help us better visualize the difference between lesser used platforms like Snapchat and Twitter

#make summary data by platform for waffle plot. Put in descending order so lesser used platforms are closer to the legend. Play around with row number. 

waffle <- one_plat2 %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(platform) %>%

#BC: I changed 220 to `nrow(.)` to increase reproducibility. Best to avoid hard-coding wherever possible. 

#round to make 100 boxes
waffle_pr <- waffle_p %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 0)

#BC: Cool use of `mutate_if()`! Thanks for teaching me this function. 

#plot and add title

#Add computer glyphs and title, this is not working yet, I am still playing around with it 
library(extrafont)

font_import()
# check that Font Awesome is imported
fonts()[grep("Awesome", fonts())]


waffle(waffle_pr, rows = 10, title="Chosen Social Media for Single Platform Users")

#BC: This is probably my favorite plot! It's really visualizing appealing and intuitive. I definitely agree that it does a much better job than a bar graph, especially for communicating differences among platforms with fewer overall users. Amazing job!
